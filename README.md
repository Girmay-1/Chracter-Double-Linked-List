#### Chracter-Double-Linked-List
This is a simple demo for a character double linked list using the java programming language. The Iterable inteface is 
implemeneted to facilitate the use of the enhaced "for -each loop" statement. The java list type provides a simple 
way of doing the same thing - this approach may be considered for academic purposes.
